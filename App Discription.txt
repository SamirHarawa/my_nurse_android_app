My Nurse version 1.0

the applicatoin is in production phase thus the login credentials are currently blank.
the credentials are to safeguard the medical record on the device. In the view of confidentiality of medical records.

The idea was taken on board looking at the issue of drug adherance. There is a feeling that if people are to adhere
to the medicine they receive at the hospitals the government will reduce costs of the medication as with the 
issue of drug resistance on the rise. The application is meant to be a nurse at home. Alerting the user of the device
when to take medication.

In the upgrade of the application, the app will be capturing symptoms everytime the user is getting medicatoin. With 
some predefined symptom combination, the application is to be advising the user to see a medical personnel with immediate 
effect. Another prospect is putting the application online to be updating a central server at a desinated location and a 
medical personnel to be giving advise on the symptoms.
